This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk. The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers to disk and how often mdb_env_sync() is called. However, if the filesystem preserves write order and the MDB_WRITEMAP flag is not used, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose D (durability). I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions. Note that (MDB_NOSYNC | MDB_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no hint for when to write transactions to disk, unless mdb_env_sync() is called. (MDB_MAPASYNC | MDB_WRITEMAP) may be preferable.

As with MDB_NOSYNC, a system crash can then corrupt the database or lose the last transactions. Calling mdb_env_sync() ensures on-disk database integrity until next commit. This flag may be changed at any time using mdb_env_set_flags()."],[18,"EnvNoMemInit","","Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces in the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data file is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in subsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other code (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the data file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate and free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable it using this flag. This option can be a problem for applications which handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with MDB_WRITEMAP, which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The initialization is also skipped if MDB_RESERVE is used; the caller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was reserved in that case. This flag may be changed at any time using mdb_env_set_flags()."],[18,"EnvCreateFixedMap","","Use a fixed address for the mmap region. This flag must be\n specified when creating the environment, and is stored persistently\n in the environment. If successful, the memory map will always reside\n at the same virtual address and pointers used to reference data items\n in the database will be constant across multiple invocations. This \noption may not always work, depending on how the operating system has\n allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses. The feature is highly experimental."],[18,"EnvCreateNoSubDir","","By default, LMDB creates its environment in a directory whose\npathname is given in path, and creates its data and lock files\nunder that directory. With this option, path is used as-is\nfor the database main data file. The database lock file is\nthe path with \"-lock\" appended."],[18,"EnvCreateNoSync","","Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a\ntransaction.

This is\nfaster and uses fewer mallocs, but loses protection from\napplication bugs like wild pointer writes and other bad updates\ninto the database. Incompatible with nested\ntransactions. Processes with and without MDB_WRITEMAP on the\nsame environment do not cooperate well."],[18,"EnvCreataMapAsync","","When using MDB_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk.

This flag may be\nchanged at any time using mdb_env_set_flags()."],[18,"EnvCreateNoTls","","Don't use Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to\nffi::MDB_txn objects instead of to threads. I.e. mdb_txn_reset()\nkeeps the slot reseved for the ffi::MDB_txn object. A thread may\nuse parallel read-only transactions. A read-only transaction may\nspan threads if the user synchronizes its use. Applications that\nmultiplex many user threads over individual OS threads need this\noption. Such an application must also serialize the write\ntransactions in an OS thread, since LMDB's write locking is\nunaware of the user threads."],[18,"EnvCreateNoLock","","Don't do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the\ncaller must manage all concurrency itself. For proper operation\nthe caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure\nthat no readers are using old transactions while a writer is\nactive. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so\nthat no readers may be active at all when a writer begins. "],[18,"EnvCreateNoReadAhead","","Turn off readahead. Most operating systems perform readahead on\nread requests by default. This option turns it off if the OS\nsupports it. Turning it off may help random read performance\nwhen the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.
